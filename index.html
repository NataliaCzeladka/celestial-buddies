                        Through our regular meetups and stargazing events, we strive to foster a passion for astronomy
                        and inspire a sense of awe and curiosity about the cosmos.</p>

                    <p>We offer a range of exciting activities.</p>
                    <p>Our regular monthly meetups are held on the first Friday of every month at 6 pm. They provide a
                        platform for members to share their knowledge, learn from experts, and explore fascinating
                        topics related to astronomy and space exploration. Through our engaging classes, presentations
                        and thought-provoking discussions, we aim to foster a vibrant learning environment where
                        everyone can expand their understanding of the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>In addition to our regular meetups, we also organize stargazing events. Since the visibility of
                        celestial objects is dependent on weather conditions, these events are often organized on
                        relatively short notice. It allows us to make the most of clear skies and offer unique
                        opportunities to observe planets and other astronomical phenomena through telescopes.</p>

                        wonders. Please note that our stargazing events are weather-dependent and may be organized on
