                <div class="basic-info-column">
                    <p>We are a group of stargazers and space enthusiasts dedicated to exploring the wonders of the night sky.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're a seasoned astronomer or just starting your celestial journey, our club offers a welcoming community
                    where you can learn, share, and marvel at the vastness of the universe. Through our regular meetups and stargazing
                    events, we strive to foster a passion for astronomy and inspire a sense of awe and curiosity about the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>Join us as we embark on celestial adventures, observe distant galaxies, study celestial objects, and deepen our
                    understanding of the mysteries beyond Earth.</p>
                    <p>Together, let's unlock the secrets of the universe and appreciate the beauty that lies millions of light-years away.</p>

                <div class="basic-info-column">
                    <p>We offer a range of exciting activities.</p>
                    <p>Every first Friday of the month at 6 pm, we gather for our engaging classes, presentations, and thought-provoking
                    discussions. These meetups provide a platform for members to share their knowledge, learn from experts, and explore
                    fascinating topics related to astronomy and space exploration. Our aim is to foster a vibrant learning environment
                    where everyone can expand their understanding of the cosmos.</p>
                    <p>In addition to our regular meetups, we also organize stargazing events. Since the visibility of celestial objects is
                    dependent on weather conditions, these events are often organized on relatively short notice. It allows us to make
                    the most of clear skies and offer unique opportunities to observe planets and other astronomical phenomena through
                    telescopes.</p>

                <div class="basic-info-column">
                    <p>For our engaging lectures, presentations and discussions, we gather at the Skegness Library, located at 23 Roman
                    Bank. This vibrant venue provides us not only with a comfortable and welcoming space to delve into the fascinating
                    world of astronomy, but also with a selection of our favourite astronomy magazines to keep us updated with the
                    latest astronomical discoveries.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to our stargazing events, we invite you to meet us at the roof of the Gibraltar Point Cafe situated
                    next to the car park at the Gibraltar Point. This unique vantage point offers unobstructed views of the night sky,
                    making it the perfect spot for observing celestial wonders. Please note that our stargazing events are
                    weather-dependent and may be organized on short notice, so keep an eye on our website and social media channels for
                    updates.</p>
